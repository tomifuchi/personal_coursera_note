# Coursera personal note
This repo documents my knowledge when I finished coursera course on Machine learning.  In the course some of these algorithms were not general enough. Either they're
tied to something really specific or doesn't support multivarates. Here in this folder I've organized the notes into orders. The writings is very very rough, maybe
containing explicit languages too. But..It's who I'm, this note is supposed for personal use. But to demonstrates that I really do understand the course. 
The folder have to be upload and share.

Again this is very rough knowledge, as I further my understanding when I learn Linear algebra and Machine learning theory, I'm going to fix up and clarify
some of the concept in this folder.

Similar to stochastic gradient descend, how are you going to train the model with too much information ? You train it one by one and adapt accordingly. You may
stumble but...You'll eventually arrive at the optimal solution. Eventually.
