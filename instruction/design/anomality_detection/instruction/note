HOW TO RUN, Read the note in the design folder section V

#1 Assuming that you have already processed data into X, you now
have to choose to use multivariate or product of normal distribution.

#2 Find your parameters mu and sigma2 with params_gauss. sigma2
should be a vector. that is diagonal matrix. To get a matrix SIGMA
read the note.

#3 If you choose product then just run product gaussian then with
X sigma and mu. Get p_x.

#3 IF you choose multivariate then just run multivariate then
with X sigma and mu. Get p_x.

#4 Predict your prediction with p_x suing
y_pred = p_x < epsilon

#4.5 To get the best epsilon use, then go back to #4
[bestEpsilon bestF1] = selectThreshold(yval, y_prediction_validation_set);

#5 To see if your calculation is correct, true inthe end to print
#out the results
calF1(y_pred, y, true);
