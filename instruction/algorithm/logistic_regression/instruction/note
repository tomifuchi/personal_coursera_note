How to run:
Prepare X, y, num_label=unique(y), lambda usually 0.01 0.1 1 10 100
Theta's usually randomly initialized, or zero's. Running randomly initialized
theta's often times do give lower cost function theta's.

When inserting theta's into cost function it's mx1 not 1xm. If it's multiple variables
that is for each row i is y = group i, and theta's for that group i. To insert it into
a cost function, you must index it out. turn it from 1xm to mx1.

* Run OneVsAll to get theta 
* Put theta in predictOneVsAll desired X and num_label=unique(y)
